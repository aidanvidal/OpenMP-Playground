### OpenMP Playground
This repo contains some programs I am making to explore and get familiar with OpenMP and multi-threading in general.

## NBody
A gravity particle simulation for the N Body problem.  
Fun to make and really shocking how much threading increased performance.  
With my 8-core machine, 20,000 particles run smoothly at ~120 FPS, whereas with no threads, 20,000 particles is very choppy.  
Use scroll to zoom in and out.
